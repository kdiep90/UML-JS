				<p>This website is dedicated to explaining the primary aspects of the study of philosophy to people who are curious but don't know where to start. I've outlined the four primary areas of study and provided some examples of problems that one would deal with in thinking about these ideas. Admittedly the subjects themselves are far removed from the things most people talk about or think about in their daily lives. Despite that, however, these subjects and ideas are at play in the background in nearly every single aspect of our day-to-day life, from the laws you follow while driving to the code that determines what you see on your Facebook news feed. At worst, I hope this website arms you with something to talk about and impress people with at the next party you attend. At best, I hope it gets you more interested in thinking about all the myriad questions philosophy attempts to answer.</p>
