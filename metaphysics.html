				<h2>Summary, Quick and Simple</h2>
				<p>Metaphysics is the study of being. The big questions usually include things like, "What is existence?", "What does it mean to exist?", "What makes something a thing?", "Where does onething stop and another thing start?", "What is time?", etc. These questions all deal with the existance, identity, and qualities of things and objects in the most general sense.</p>
				<br />
				<h2>Thought Experiments</h2>
				<h3>Ship of Theseus</h3>
				<p>Suppose you have a ship made of wooden planks. Now suppose that over the years, each plank of wood was replaced by a new plank of wood to keep the ship fresh. Eventually all of the wooden planks are replaced and none of the original planks are still attached to the ship. Is it the same ship? At what point does it stop being the orignial ship? If it's possible that this final product is the same ship as the orignial, then suppose we then take all the orignial planks and put those together into another ship. What then?</p>
				<h3>Is Space Absolute or Relative?</h3>
				<p>In the days before Newtonian physics was widely accepted, Newton and another scientist/philosopher, Gottfried Leibniz, got into a heated disagreement over the nature of space. Newton argued that space was absolute and infinite. Space has always and will always exist and is something with concrete and measurable distance. How else is it that objects, such as us, and light can travel through it? Where else would objects be but "in" space? The dimensions (up/down, left/right, forward/backward) don't depend on the objects that we describe using these words. Leibniz argued, on the other hand, that space was relative. He believed that space is only measured in relation to existing objects. If we have one object, how are we to know what is up and down or left and right? Even if we have two objects, we only have the distance between them and can only describe the space around them in terms of the relationship between these two objects.</p>
				<br />
				<h2>Why it's important to think about</h2>
				<p>While the subject itself is very esoteric/out of touch with anything people normally deal with in their daily lives, it does occasioally lead to remarkable discoveries about our world. Without the debate between Newton and Leibniz, for example, we would have never had Einstein's theory of relativity. Relativity merges and reconciles the theories of absolute and relative space: all measurements of space and time are relative to the observer, but space and time in general can be treated as one (absolute) thing and hence light will always have an absolute and finite speed. It goes without saying that relativity has had a massive impact on the kinds of technology we have available to us today, and all of that is thanks to a centuries-old metaphysics debate.</p>
